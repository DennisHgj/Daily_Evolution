## Minuted Meetings
+ [Meeting 3 - date - consider and plan extension aspects](meeting3- 11/05/2019-
On Saturday, we met together again and started to consider and plan extension aspects.
 First, we considered to design a home interface, with a good-looking picture in it.
 The home interface should also be able to display weather conditions in some area.
 Next, Linyu Xia came out an idea of adding a function of alarm to our app.
 The alarm is linked to a clock and able to remind users when necessary.
 Chao Zhang proposed that we should add four buttons to notepad: New(create new notes),
 Clear(clear input words), Cancel(go back to the main interface), Add(add a new record and go back to main interface).
 Guanjie Huang thought that the function of transaction could show users details of transactions and classify transactions into different categories.)
