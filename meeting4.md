## Minuted Meetings
+ [Meeting 4 - date - review and practice demo](meeting4- 18/05/2019-
On Saturday, we met together again and started to play around with our app and review if there is anything to improve.
So far, the function of weather forecast and GPS haven't been completed.
What's more, we are supposed to decorate our home interface e.g. use some beautiful pictures.
 We run the app and had a look at implementation of functions. Notebook runs normally.
 Alarm could also achieve the desired effects.
 As to transaction, it can show the expenditure and income of a user.
 Moreover, it can record amount of expenditure and show percentages of expenditure sorted by different usage.
 For example, food $1000, transport $800, accommodation $1200 etc.
 Overall, we basically complete the expected functions.
 And we still need some tests of both code and the app. )
