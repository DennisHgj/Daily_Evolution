Unit testing(JUnit5) is used on the majority of the project.
 We also consider to do both black box and white box testing.
 Some integration testing on our system is done.
 And we also run our app to see whether four functions are implemented normally.
 The result is that home, alarm, notebook and transaction(4 modules) can basically implement their separate functions. )
